# DashWP
An easier, simpler way to manage content for WordPress.

**NOTE:** This plugin is actively being developed, and is not yet recommended for use in production.

## Big picture

DashWP is a suite of tools to help you manage the content, and content architecture, of your Wordpress site. In addition to filling typical needs (e.g. custom post type/taxonomy creation, bulk post conversion actions, etc) DashWP enables the creation of *dashboards* to easily manage content that belongs in a group. 

## What is a dashboard?

A dashboard is just a cleaner, faster interface for editing/managing lots of content at once. Think of it like the Media Library, only it contains posts of many different types (rather than attachments of many different media types)! 

When you visit a dashboard, you can filter all the associated posts by type, or perform a real-time search for exactly what you need. Each post is represented with cards that make it easy to make quick changes, without needing to leave the dashboard for the editor. You can customize the fields displayed in the quick editor by post type.

## Roadmap 

I'm just getting started on DashWP! Some features in the works:

- Capabilities Overhaul *(it's not secure right now! **do not** use in the wild!)*
- Google Docs style permissions per post/dashboard
- Bulk Actions (post type conversions, taxonomy conversions)
- Custom taxonomy management
- Presets / Wizards for content architecture
- Complete ACF Integration
- Calendar View on Dashboards
- Budget View on Dashbaords
- DashWP Plugin API (+ biiiig refactor)
